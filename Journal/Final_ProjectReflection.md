## This is my Reflection for my Final Project


- First to mention, I had chosen to update the Javascript game I had as my final project, so that is what I did. 

*  I had brainstormed on the intial thing that i had wanted to add to my game, to me it seemed like it could be tweaked a bit to enhance the user experience. I the firts thing I thought about or came to midn was the error in the speed of the ball. I didnt like how it would vary in speeds everytime someone los, so I changed it.

 here is a list of the chages I made or tried to:

 1. I made it so that the speed of the ball increase evrytime a player lost.

 2. I also added levels, and put the count at the corner of the screern just so that the users will be abel to tell what level of the game they are at as it corresposnds to speed.

 3. Lastly, i think this update is pretty cool. I added a pausing mechanism to the game, just so that the players who are going against one another would be able to pause the game, almost as if it is frozen whenevr they went. Maybe if they want to leave and come back to it later. 


# these are the chnages I had made to the game, I plan to add more, but this is for now.
