Over the course of the time that I had to study different websites of businesses that I choose to align with. I found one thing that was common amongst all the websites. This was the urgency of all their wbe pages. As soon as you open up the screen, in large texts there is either a quote (motto) or very noticable imagery that went into making their front page. Whether that is from the picture they ued or the sturcture of the full page, they mkae their stance clear. That is something I tried to mirror in my homepage to the best of my ability. I tried to encaptivate the readers attention from the very startof the pressing on the link to my website. One other thing that I noticed was prevalent through each website was how they highlight or include news or new findings in the world of tech, even consulting.  They either have a news page or certain facts that could really get the reader engaged in the topic, this is something I tried to do. I had a news page I also made my point clear and persuasive to the audience, that is so they know what my buisness does from the start.



In terms of working with WordPress I found that adding and deleting pages was easy. Overall the whole procces of making my website was enoyable, I learned a few things and I had to go through trial and error to see whether if somethings would work or not. Of the things I found easy, one thing I found pretty difficult was first starting out. If I wanted to input a text or format my boxes just the way I wanted on my page it would've taken some time for me to get through it, but i eventually did, and I really like the way my website looks right know. If I need to I can go back to and changes, which I what I really like and enjoy about WordPress, and the creativity it gives.
