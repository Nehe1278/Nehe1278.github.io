# Here are my math notes.


## So far in my Math class we have been learing about limits, I will go over just some of the important things to know about limits.

- Firstly know how limit notation would normally like:

$\lim_{x \to  +\infty} f(x) = \infty$


Essentially this just says on a graph, that as x approaches the positive side of the x-axis and goes to the infinity, f(x) or y would be approaching infinity or be going up as well. Here's how it would look like in a graph:


[This is the image of a cubic graph, where if you look at the positive portion of the graph you will see that f(x) appraoches infinity](https://files.mtstatic.com/site_4425/2460/0?Expires=1729119470&Signature=fZ6C2r-jyf0nMKh~7OwmM8B7g0-GT~x45Ueh24u3zMibF-T0D~44Nu3HzPSJCVWMmb~TFvcBI4s7~w1iEBh0SgclVfwwzHptgX6LWrJW~IRFL~~-Y00UtylkhhG4Lgyoz6fxUQF-eqeTX5bJ4F-74lz3D5MpbyKSUDhe4RbOxgo_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJ5Y6AV4GI7A555NA)
