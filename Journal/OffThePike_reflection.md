A reflection on the development process - how sharing code with others went, how pulling and merging went, and how branch-based development (with pull requests) went.

- Here is the link to the website I created:

-here are the screenshots of the pages I wrote:

# Short description of my form:
 - Some of the input types that I used on my form was tel to get the user phone number, name to get the uses full name, email to get the users email, etc. For most of these inputs I had also incorporated a place holder inside the text entry to help the user, if they did not understand what characters they should use and what not.

- In terms of the method I used. I had used the post method to send the most updated user data that was taken in, to the server.

# Reflection: 
-  Honestly, in terms for the development process, it was alright for the most part. Except, there was this one time where I had gotten into a merge conflict because someone else had made shanges to my page and I hadnt seen them and then push without pulling. That became a persistent issue quicly, but advice within vim was telling me that I had to fix the working tree and said that I should run this command before my next pull: git config rebase false. Luckily this did help, and before my next pull, I was able to get everything up to date.
