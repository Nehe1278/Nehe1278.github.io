# My Game Design Idea

1. What will the genre of my game be

- Honestly I think the genre of my game will be a puzzle or fun game, or it might be attack my current idea for the game is a Ping pong designed type game.

2. What are the objectives? Will there be a score? How do you win or lose?

- If you lose against the other person, you lose over all, there are levels to the game, and with each level characteristics change.


3. How will the player interact with the game?

- The player will most likley use the sliders or paddels to hit the ball back and forth.


4. What features will you include in your MVP?

- So definiently to sliders that each person will be able to control, I will probably need to make a small ball, etc. Then eventually set the speed and levels of the ball.
