# My Game Design Idea

1. What will the genre of my game be

- Honestly I think the genre of my game will be a puzzle or fun game, or it might be attack.


2. What are the objectives? Will there be a score? How do you win or lose?

- If you lose control of the game you lose.


3. How will the player interact with the game?

- The player will most likley use the sliders to control the ball, i will most likey


4. What features will you include in your MVP?

- So definiently to sliders that each person will be able to control, I will probably need to make a small ball, etc.
