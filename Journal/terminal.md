# My journey Learining the Terminal

* Entrie


1. The Importance of the Terminal, git, vim, and Markdown

- The terminal is important because it allows users to directly access there computers operation
via commadn lines, it is very efficicent and you can certantly preform many tasks with it, includes making website buling much more simplr as well as accessing certain files and folders deep within
your computer.

- git's importance is unprecedented, it tracks crucial changes you make to your code making 
it easier for readers to tell the story of how it came about to be. Git definienlty makes it easier for collaboration as many people can work together on the same project adding repositories, or
commits to the same code. Git is a very collabortive friendly platform which allows you to build a
story of your code tracking changes as you go.

- Vim's importance is its text editor feature, as it makes it so much more simpler to edit and make chnages to your website. It gets easier the more you use it. It's text editor makes preforming
tasks much simpler, to be honest I like it.

- The Markdown tool, again just like vim makes website creation a bunch more easier as you can
combine the both add simplistic features to your website. 


2. To be honest I really am enjoying using the terminal, vim, and the website creation process. I
do plan on adding things to my website including other links to my projects as well as other wbesite I create. 


3. If i was to give advice to future students who are interested in learning how to navigate the
terminal and or make website. I would say to get good or comfortable with the cd and ls command     lines as well as other commands that help you go through the terminal. but specifically those two
are the bread and butter of navigation and learning and getting good at the will make it so much
easier. I would also say learn the vim editor, as learning will make website building a simpler and greater experience.
