                  <h3>Directions of the Game</h3>
                <p>So for this game I created, Its pretty self explanatory.</p>

                 <p>There are two players, <u>player 1</u> and <u>player 2</u>, both these players are controlled by with <kbd>w</kbd> and <kbd>s</kbd> or <kbd>UpArrow</kbd> and <kbd>DownArrow</kbd> </p>  
                    <p>The Objective of the game is for player 1 and player 2 to battlke it out, untile one lets the ball get past them or cross their barrier, this is intented to simulate the real life game of Ping Pong.</p>
